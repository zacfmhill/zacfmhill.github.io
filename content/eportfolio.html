                    <p class="txxt">Hello, and welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Zachary Friedman-Hill, and I am
                        pursuing a degree
                        in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland,with minors in Robotics
                        and Autonomous Systems and Computer Science. Through my academic journey and research in the
                        Gemstone Honors Program I've focused on advancing robotics, design, and sutonomous systems to
                        solve real-world challenges. This portfolio showcases the work I've done across research,
                        design, and industry applications,
                        including projects in swarm robotics, autonomous vehicles, advanced prototyping, and sustainable
                        manufacturing processes. Each project reflects my dedication to innovation, teamwork, and
                        technical
                        precision. As a future professional, I aim to leverage my expertise in robotics, design
                        engineering, and
                        manufacturing to create solutions that are not only technically sound but also socially
                        impactful. I
                        invite you to explore my work and see how my skills, values, and goals align with the
                        opportunities
                        of tomorrow.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">Personal Statement</h2>
                <p class="txxt">I believe that engineering is not only about solving technical problems but also about
                    creating
                    solutions that serve diverse communities and foster equity. My experiences at the University of
                    Maryland, particularly through the Gemstone Honors Program, have shown me the power of collaboration
                    across multiple disciplines, cultures, and perspectives. In my roles as a research intern, design
                    engineer, and team leader, I have worked with peers and
                    students from varied backgrounds, ensuring that their ideas were valued and supported. I've seen
                    firsthand how inclusivity strengthens both teams and outcomes. As I move forward, my goal is to
                    continue developing technologies that not only advance engineering but also promote accessibility,
                    environmental responsibility, and positive social impact.</p>

                    systems into a
                    cohesive autonomous robotics solution. In this technical assessment, I selected and justified key
                    components for an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle, developed a control architecture using
                    GPS,
                    IMUs, and Extended Kalman Filtering, and proposed testing benchmarks for safety and reliability.

                <p class="txxt">
                    My portfolio highlights how I've grown into someone who
                    combines strong technical skills with a passion for solving meaningful problems. Early research in
                    swarm
                    robotics allowed me to gain skills in teamwork and communication, while projects like building an
                    autonomous
                    vehicle showed me how to apply creativity under real-world constraints. In my internships and lab
                    work, I've focused on making design choices that have impact. At Terrapin
                    Works and Current Sets, I helped develop sustainable manufacturing processes and coordinated complex
                    design projects. More recently at Polygone Systems, I designed an autonomous boat for microplastic
                    cleanup, which pushed me to connect technical innovation with environmental responsibility.
                    Outside the classroom, I've led the Leatherbacks Combat Robotics Team and contributed to the
                    Accessible
                    Prosthetics Initiative. Both taught me rapid, user oriented, design and effective team
                    collaboration. Altogether, these experiences shaped me into an engineer who brings technical
                    rigor, creativity, and purpose to all their work.
